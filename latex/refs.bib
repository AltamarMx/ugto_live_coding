The study addresses the drivers and environmental pressure within the industrial sector on the National Electricity System (NES). This article aims to characterize the metabolic pattern of the NES and the industrial sector using the Multiscale Integrated Analysis of Social and Ecological Metabolism (MuSIASEM) from a bioeconomic perspective to identify fields of opportunity in the regulatory policy instruments. A set of extensive and intensive variables (2019) on energy, production factors, and emissions was used at different hierarchical levels based on both subsectors. Our results show that the NES used primary energy sources (PES) and secondary energy carriers to fulfill its functions, of which 72\% were domestic sources and 28\% were imported. México imported 79.5\% of the natural gas (NG) for electricity generation. However, there are favorable conditions for renewable PES to increase the installed capacity of solar plants between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude and 2–3 in wind power from the current capacity. NES's energy consumption per hour of human time is 17,388 MJ/h, with 65\% being the heat equivalent to a total energy input consumed of 2139 PJ/y. Public plants contributed 43.7\% to the generation, and the independent and self-supply producers the rest. End uses needed the supply of 69.3\% of electricity from baseload plants. Sixty-three percent of the metabolic pattern of the industrial sector is based on heat and fuel processes, which depend on NG imports. The NES is reorganizing and recovering its energy autonomy.}},

Hence, the United Nations has suggested that an increase of 1.5°C above the reference temperature corresponding to the beginning of industrial revolution era must be avoided. One proposal to mitigate this global warming is the migration towards green energy generation systems, however, suitable predictions of electricity demand are required to properly manage the implementation and operation of hybrid energy generation systems with high penetration of renewable energies. In this paper, a simple mathematical model based on sinusoidal functions which consider the normal time periods of the society like daily, weekly, monthly, and annual is proposed for the electricity demand in Mexico. The model parameters were obtained from the historical data from 2017 to 2021, furthermore, the model was used to estimate the electricity demand for the year 2022 as a demonstration of its usefulness, obtaining a mean absolute error of 0.9\% in the whole year period. The proposed model is simple and can be used to reproduce and estimate the electricity demand of the national interconnected system.}},

Monthly mean capacity factors above 45\% were estimated from October to June, with the maximum values near 60\% between March and April. Conversely, minimum values were observed from July to September but consistently higher than 30\%. The analyzed zones show suitable technical conditions for offshore wind development.

The analysis highlights Mexico’s capacity to produce up to 217.33 million tons of hydrogen annually, predominantly from the Gulf of Mexico. Centralized offshore hydrogen production demonstrates significant cost advantages, being up to 0.92 USD/kg cheaper than onshore production. The study also underscores the economic benefits of repurposing existing oil and gas infrastructure, which can reduce LCOH by up to 11\%. Environmental benefits are substantial, with hydrogen use in ammonia production potentially reducing CO2eq emissions by 82.5\%. Additionally, the study identifies highly suitable offshore areas for hydrogen production, particularly near existing oil infrastructure, facilitating the integration of new renewable energy projects with minimal additional infrastructure development.

Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid rise of renewables. The impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity sector led to a reduction in the demand for electricity, while at the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed the security and affordability of electricity at the top of the political agenda in many countries. In this way, the decrease in the demand for electricity, as well as its gradual recovery, makes it necessary to carry out energy planning that considers the adverse effects caused by global events with a high socioeconomic impact. In this article, the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) 2020 software has been used to determine the distribution of energy sources to 2050 for Mexico. The variables that lead to the possible profiles for 2050 are social, economic, and technological. The results correspond to a possible future based on official data from the National Electric System (SEN) of Mexico. The forecast for 2050 indicates that the electricity sector will have almost double the current installed capacity; however, emissions do not correspond to twice as much: they are practically 50\% higher.}},

The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following the concept of an equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50\% relative humidity (but vapour pressure capped at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin wettedness, skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid. The analyses of the sensitivity of UTCI to humidity, radiation and wind speed showed plausible reactions in the heat as well as in the cold, and indicate that UTCI may in this regard be universally useable in the major areas of research and application in human biometeorology.}},

First we analyze the interaction between the socio-economic structure and the temperature dependence pattern (TDP) of energy demand. We find that socio-economic changes may alter the TDP in various ways. Next we investigate how current studies manage these dynamics in socio-economic structure. We find that many studies systematically misrepresent the possible effect of socio-economic changes on the TDP of energy demand. Finally, we assess the consequences of these misrepresentations in an energy demand model based on temperature dependence and climate scenarios. Our model results indicate that expected socio-economic dynamics generally lead to an underestimation of future energy demand in models that misrepresent such dynamics. We conclude that future energy demand models should improve the incorporation of socio-economic dynamics. We propose dynamically modeling several key parameters and using direct meteorological data instead of degree days.}},

The deployment of smart meters enables us to analyse weather effects in different periods of the day using hourly panel datasets, which would previously have been impossible. To conduct the analysis, fixed-effects models are employed on half-hourly electricity consumption data from 3827 Irish household meters. We demonstrate that temperature has robust and relatively flat effects on electricity demand across all periods, whereas rain and sunshine duration show greater potential to affect individual behaviour and daily routines. The models show that the most sensitive periods differ for each weather variable. We also test the responses to weather factors for weekends and workdays. Weather sensitivities vary with the day of the week, which might be caused by different household patterns over the course of the week. The methodology employed in this study could be instructive for improving understanding behavioural response in household energy consumption. By using only weather indicators, this approach can be quicker and simpler than traditional methods —such as surveys or questionnaires — in identifying the periods when households are more responsive. • Temperature has robust and flat effects on electricity demand across all periods. • Rain and sunshine have greater potential to affect people’s consumption behaviour. • Sunshine sensitivity increases from late afternoon and peaks in early evening. • More rain-sensitive activities occur before mid-afternoon during weekdays. • In the mornings, sunlight has positive effects on weekend consumptions.}},

We use hourly electricity demand from a sample of Italian residences over a full year to examine how sensitive residential demand is to temperature. Our regression model includes a rich set of household-by-time fixed effects to control for dwelling characteristics and equipment, family composition, work and business schedules, demand for lighting, and seasonal habits other than temperature. These allows us to separate the effect of temperature from the demand for lighting and from other seasonal effects that may be correlated with temperature, but are not temperature. We find that demand stays unchanged within a relatively narrow range (and is thus relatively flat) up to temperatures of about 24.4°C, and increases sharply with temperature thereafter. We find that temperature accounts for a very small share of daily electricity demand. Only on exceptionally hot summer days can temperature account for 12\% of hourly electricity use.}},

The objective of this study is to understand and quantify the role of temperature variability on electricity consumption over representative areas of the Southern United States. We consider two states, Tennessee and Texas, which represent different climate regimes and have limited electricity trade with adjacent regions. Results from regression tests indicate that regional population growth explains most of the variability in electricity demand at decadal time scales, whereas temperature explains 44–67\% of the electricity demand variability at seasonal time scales. Seasonal temperature forecasts from general circulation models are also used to develop season-ahead power demand forecasts. Results suggest that the use of climate forecasts can potentially help to project future residential electricity demand at the monthly time scale. Capsule Summary: Seasonal temperature forecasts from GCMs can potentially help in predicting season-ahead residential power demand forecasts for states in the Southern US.}},

Increasing generation from renewable energy sources is already changing supply variability at the hourly and seasonal timescales. Our aim is to conduct a rigorous study of European historical demand, to understand its relationship with social and weather drivers and, therefore, to gain insights into appropriate storage needs.  Daily activity profiles exhibit notable differences across European countries, with some of them reporting a consistent demand reduction, up to 25\%, during school closures and Christmas festivities. In addition, temperature sensitivity differentiates demand by countries’ latitude (north vs. south), and by technologies (electric heating vs. other fuel based heating). Assuming a 100\% renewables scenario, European countries would display quite distinct periodicities and amplitudes of their residual electricity demands.  Annual load curves and temperature sensitivities of nations with high electric heating or cooling demand can assist in the prediction of future electricity and other fuel consumption under increased electrification and climate change scenarios. Fourier periodicity and residual demand analysis suggest that, in addition to grid storage, European countries with mutual energy needs – in terms of seasonal demand and generation surplus – might benefit from international trade to balance unmet demand. Our study of consumption variability in response to social and weather drivers constitutes a valuable resource to formulate country-specific demand scenarios, as well as to improve the design of energy system models.}},

   abstract = {We have attempted to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations in summer thermal heat stress/discomfort over the Indian region-based universal thermal climate index (UTCI) in this study. We have calculated UTCI using hourly ERA5 data of 10 m wind speed, 2 m air temperature, 2 m dew point temperature, and solar radiation for the period 1990–2020. To determine the effect of radiation fluxes and soil moisture on temperature and UTCI, we have used ERA5 data on cloud fraction (CF), surface heat fluxes (SLHF and SSHF), and soil moisture (SM) for the study period. Maximum heating and discomfort have been reported in May for most of the regions. Except for the west region, the progress of the monsoon provides some relief in June. Maximum discomfort is observed around 08–09Z. We have observed over 50% of India experiencing a decreasing trend in UTCI in different summer months despite over 50% of India experiencing an increasing trend in temperature. This is due to the influence of factors such as solar radiation, cloudiness, wind speed, soil moisture, etc., on UTCI. The UTCI in summer months demonstrates spatial heterogeneity. UTCI increases significantly in the west region in April and the east region in June. In April and May, some portions of the South-Central region, particularly Maharashtra, exhibit an increasing trend in UTCI. The majority of the North-Central region has a noticeable decreasing tendency in UTCI in all the summer months. We have not found any significant trend in the frequency of days with ‘very high heat stress’ or higher discomfort. Except in the eastern region, there is no noticeable trend in the frequency of discomfort hours with UTCI in the ranges 38 < UTCI < 46°C and UTCI > 46°C. The Eastern region exhibits an increasing trend in the frequency of discomfort hours with UTCI in the range of 38 < UTCI < 46°C in April. The Eastern region has a rising trend in the frequency of discomfort hours, with UTCI in the range of 38 < UTCI < 46°C in April.},

Predictions with 250-m grid spacing over the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, reveal that spatial distribution of both WBGT and UTCI are similarly sensitive to mesoscale features such as the lake-breeze flows. Accurate prediction of WBGT and its indicators is found as evaluated with measurements during clear-sky and cloudy condition cases. In particular in clear-sky conditions the scattering index of solar radiation from the atmospheric model is found to be more realistic than fixed values. Links between intermediate important variables representing thermal load on a body, the mean radiant temperature (TMR), and a synthetic variable equivalent to the globe temperature (TG) as measured with a globe thermometer sensor are closely analyzed. Results show that the use of distinct TMRWBGT and TMRUTCI leads to differences of up to 50% due to a different energy partitioning and that TMR and TG are linked through a hysteresis cycle.}

In this work, we provide a simple methodology to identify areas prone to concurrent hazards, exemplified with, but not limited to, heat stress and fire danger. We use the combined heat and forest fire event that affected Europe in June 2017 to demonstrate that the methodology can be used for analysing past events as well as making predictions, by using reanalysis and medium-range weather forecasts, respectively. We present new spatial layers that map the combined danger and make suggestions on how these could be used in the context of a Multi-Hazard Early Warning System. These products could be particularly valuable in disaster risk reduction and emergency response management, particularly for civil protection, humanitarian agencies and other first responders whose role is to identify priorities during pre-interventions and emergencies.}

   abstract = {In this work, the potential of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as a heat-related health risk indicator in Europe is demonstrated. The UTCI is a bioclimate index that uses a multi-node human heat balance model to represent the heat stress induced by meteorological conditions to the human body. Using 38 years of meteorological reanalysis data, UTCI maps were computed to assess the thermal bioclimate of Europe for the summer season. Patterns of heat stress conditions and non-thermal stress regions are identified across Europe. An increase in heat stress up to 1 °C is observed during recent decades. Correlation with mortality data from 17 European countries revealed that the relationship between the UTCI and death counts depends on the bioclimate of the country, and death counts increase in conditions of moderate and strong stress, i.e., when UTCI is above 26 and 32 °C. The UTCI’s ability to represent mortality patterns is demonstrated for the 2003 European heatwave. These findings confirm the importance of UTCI as a bioclimatic index that is able to both capture the thermal bioclimatic variability of Europe, and relate such variability with the effects it has on human health.},

The existing procedures are subdivided into three main categories: Thermal indices, Empirical indices and indices based on Linear Equations; for each approach, case studies are presented and subdivided according to Koeppen Climatic Classification (Polar, Cold, Temperate, Arid and Tropical). International regulations and software available to quantify outdoor human comfort and microclimate are presented, as well as a graphic thermal scale to compare the ability of each procedure to respond to the 11-point thermal sensation scale (from Sweltering to Extremely Cold). Finally, the models are presented as function of their ability to analyse climate, microclimate and human-related characteristics of the selected built environment. This paper aims at bringing a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the outdoor human comfort, helping the reader to understand the existing procedures and guiding the choice of the suitable options according to specific research needs.}

   abstract = {Reanalysis datasets provide a continuous picture of the past climate for every point on Earth. They are especially useful in areas with few direct observations, such as Siberia. However, to ensure these datasets are sufficiently accurate they need to be validated against readings from meteorological stations. Here, we analyse how values of six climate variables—the minimum, mean and maximum 2-metre air temperature, snow depth (SD), total precipitation and wind speed (WSP)—from three reanalysis datasets—ERA-Interim, ERA5 and ERA5-Land—compare against observations from 29 meteorological stations across Siberia and the Russian Far East on a daily timescale from 1979 to 2019. All three reanalyses produce values of the mean and maximum daily 2-metre air temperature that are close to those observed, with the average absolute bias not exceeding 1.54°C. However, care should be taken for the minimum 2-metre air temperature during the summer months—there are nine stations where correlation values are <0.60 due to inadequate night-time cooling. The reanalysis values of SD are generally close to those observed after 1992, especially ERA5, when data from some of the meteorological stations began to be assimilated, but the reanalysis SD should be used with caution (if at all) before 1992 as the lack of assimilation leads to large overestimations. For low daily precipitation values the reanalyses provide good approximations, however they struggle to attain the extreme high values. Similarly, for the 10-metre WSP; the reanalyses perform well with speeds up to 2.5 ms−1 but struggle with those above 5.0 ms−1. For these variables, we recommend using ERA5 over ERA-Interim and ERA5-Land in future research. ERA5 shows minor improvements over ERA-Interim, and, despite an increased spatial resolution, there is no advantage to using ERA5-Land.},

   abstract = {This study evaluates the reliability of ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets in describing the mean daily air temperature of four climate domains in mainland Portugal. The reanalysis datasets were compared with ground observations from 94 meteorological stations (1980–2021). Overall, the results demonstrated a good degree of correlation between the observed and reanalysis data on both a daily and seasonal scale. Both the latitudinal distribution of the air temperature and the moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean are well described. However, in the case of Portugal, the ERA5-Land was shown to be considerably more effective at describing the mean daily air temperature than ERA5. The results also indicated that, in general, the reanalysis methodologies perform better when applied to air temperature simulation in flatter regions as opposed to regions with high-altitude and complex terrain. The study further suggests that ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis should be used with caution in the case of short-term environmental studies. In fact, relevant differences were shown to exist between the reanalyses and the observed daily mean air temperature datasets for certain specific years. Overall, considering the RMSE between the ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets for mean daily air temperature and the observed datasets there is a 28% probability of locally having a mean RMSE <1.5°C, 52% probability of having a mean RMSE >1.5°C and <2.0°C, and 16% probability of having a RMSE >2.0°C and <3.0°C. These conclusions will hopefully contribute to improving our understanding of the uncertainty sources in relation to ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis data for different climate domains.},

Proper evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses, however, should not be overlooked. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of ERA5 reanalysis and to document the progress made compared to ERA-interim for the fields of near-surface temperature and precipitation over Africa. Results show that in ERA5 the climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are clearly reduced and the representation of inter-annual variability is improved over most of Africa. However, both reanalysis products performed less well in terms of capturing the observed long-term trends, despite a slightly better performance of ERA5 over ERA-interim. Further regional analysis over East Africa shows that the representation of the annual cycle of precipitation is substantially improved in ERA5 by reducing the wet bias during the rainy season. The spatial distribution of precipitation during extreme years is also better represented in ERA5. While ERA5 has improved much in comparison to its predecessor, there is still demand for improved products with even higher resolution and accuracy to satisfy impact-based studies, such as in agriculture and water resources.},

   abstract = {A key aim of climate monitoring is to place the current conditions of climate variables, such as surface air temperature and precipitation, in their historical context. In Europe, a leading provider of this information is the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission. To undertake this activity in close-to-real time, C3S predominantly uses the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis, and ERA5 precipitation is widely used as a proxy for observed precipitation for hydrological monitoring. However, for there to be confidence in the ERA5 data, it is essential to evaluate its ability to capture observed precipitation. In this study, we therefore evaluate ERA5 precipitation against observations globally to inform C3S monitoring activities and the broader climate science community. Using 24 hr precipitation observations at 5,637 stations from 2001 to 2020, results show that the smallest ERA5 random errors occur in the winter Extratropics and the largest ERA5 errors are in the Tropics. The errors grow in the summer Extratropics and the errors in the Tropics move with the intertropical convergence zone. These findings are mirrored in the stable equitable error in probability space (SEEPS) score, with the SEEPS signifying that ERA5 is more able to discriminate between different precipitation events in the Extratropics. In general, an ERA5 wet bias is also found. The assessment of annual maximum 1 day (RX1) precipitation accumulations and four extreme events shows that ERA5 cannot model the highest observed precipitation totals but that it can generally capture their locations and patterns. Furthermore, an evaluation of monthly precipitation corroborated that ERA5 is more skilful in the Extratropics. These results imply that users can have confidence in ERA5 precipitation in extratropical regions, and therefore it is recommended that ERA5 is mostly used for extratropical precipitation monitoring.},

We investigate characteristics of blocks and cyclones in ERA5 using different algorithms, compare the results to ERA5's predecessor, ERA-interim, and investigate how these characteristics depend on spatial resolution. Generally, ERA5 and ERA-interim characterize blocks and cyclones similarly. For Lagrangian detection and tracking methods, blocks are more robust than cyclones to changes in resolution and reanalysis choice. Eulerian methods are robust to changes in resolution. Thus, ERA5 provides a state-of-the-art reanalysis for the synoptic-scale extratropical circulation. We find that Lagrangian cyclone characteristics are strongly dependent on spatial resolution and therefore recommend that model and reanalysis data should be mapped to a common resolution for verification.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the newly released fifth-generation reanalysis product of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), i.e., ERA5, for precipitation estimates over Chinese Mainland during 2003–2015. In this study, we evaluated the ERA5 reanalysis data using gridded gauge precipitation. Both categorical and continuous verification scores were calculated. The results show that the detection capacity of ERA5 varies across the four sub-regions of Chinese Mainland. ERA5 tends to misdetect daily precipitation events in the south of the northwestern arid climate (NAC) and north of plateau climate (PC) zones. In addition, it is more difficult for ERA5 to accurately detect moderate or higher daily precipitation events (above 10 mm/day). Error analysis show that ERA5 product has higher root mean-square error (RMSE) values in the tropical and subtropical climate zone (TSC) with a relatively wet climate. Compared to satellite-based precipitation product, ERA5 has larger relative biases in precipitation estimates over Chinese Mainland and it tends to over- and underestimate light precipitation events and moderate and heavy precipitation events, respectively. Based on the analysis of the accuracy of ERA5 during typhoon-induced extreme precipitation, ERA5 can identify the precipitation distribution and center, but underestimates extreme precipitation. Overall, the results of this study provide references for the use of ERA5 in hydrological applications over Chinese Mainland.},

Global warming rates of the 20th century have been documented by a number of studies, nevertheless, the warming rates in the most recent decades in the 21st century are of particular interest for understanding the ongoing climate change. Analyzing temperature trends demands data with high spatial resolution and broad geographical coverage to allow for analyzing trends and changes on a regional scale. Land Surface Temperature data from NASA MODIS with global resolution of 0.05° and Skin Temperature data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis with global resolution of 0.1° fulfill these demands. In this study, we analyze the remote-sensing-based MODIS data to estimate land surface temperature change rates over the period 2001–2020 in global, continental, and pixel-wise scales with statistical significance indicated. The model-based ERA5-Land data are also analyzed in parallel, extending the period of analysis back to 1981. These two independently-sourced datasets, one from satellites above the atmosphere and one from combining surface modeling and observations, are shown to produce highly consistent results. It is revealed that the trends in the shorter period 2001–2020 are spatially conforming to the trends in the longer period 1981–2020 despite the shorter time length. For the period 2001–2020, we show that the global average land surface temperature rate of change was 0.26 °C-0.34 °C per decade, with substantially different warming rates in different regions. The Arctic, Europe, and Russia show statistically significant warming in both datasets. The Arctic, in particular, warmed at a rate 2.5–2.8 times the global average, and data in the 40-year period 1981–2020 suggest that warming is accelerating in almost all the continents or large regions. Most noticeably, the two independent datasets both indicate that Arctic permafrost regions had the world's highest warming rate at the onset of the 21st century, reaching >2 °C per decade in some areas.},

This study intends to provide insights into existing human thermal comfort indices based on their applications in tropical and subtropical regions of Koppen climates for indoor and outdoor.

The result shows that most efforts were made in temperate and continental climates to derive thermal comfort indices. For outdoor thermal comfort assessment, 72\% of studies used Physiological Equivalent Temperature; 21\% used Discomfort Index and Universal Thermal Climate Index. Whereas for indoors, > 90\% of studies used the Predicted Mean Vote index and Operative Temperature. Overall, the used thermal comfort indices in reviewed studies underestimate the comfortable ranges observed in tropical and subtropical regions. The findings of this study can be utilized by researchers, urban designers, and planners to increase understanding related to human thermal comfort in tropical and subtropical climates.}},
